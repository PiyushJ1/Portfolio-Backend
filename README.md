# Portfolio Website Backend

This backend service is built with Node.js and Express to handle contact form submissions from the portfolio website. It uses Nodemailer to forward messages to a designated email address.

---

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- Nodemailer
- Validator
- CORS

---

## Overview

The backend accepts the user's first name, last name, email, and message from the frontend contact form. Inputs are then sanitised and validated to ensure security and data integrity. Valid messages are sent to the portfolio ownerâ€™s email via Gmail SMTP.

---

## Environment Configuration

The application requires the following environment variables to authenticate with Gmail:
- USER_EMAIL: your_email@gmail.com
- USER_PASSL your_emaila_app_password

Credentials are stored securely using environment variables and are never hardcoded.
